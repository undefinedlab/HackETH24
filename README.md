To test it, I would clone the zip, unzip it (source files are there... don`t ask me why, cause the answer is that I am not super fine with git and this was the solution).
then I would npm install to fill libs, and try it... do not forget env with web3auth client id... also whitelisting to test on on vercel or so. It worked, I have transactions confirming it, but it is bit dirty....
