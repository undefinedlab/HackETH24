Fanstar Project: Deployment and Testing Guide


Prerequisites

    Node.js and npm installed
    A Web3Auth client ID
    Access to a deployment platform (e.g., Vercel)


Deployment Steps

1 Obtain the Project Files

    Download the project zip file
    Extract the contents to your desired location
    Note: Source files are included in the zip for convenience


2 Install Dependencies

    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
    Run npm install to install all required libraries


3 Environment Configuration

    Create a .env file in the project root
    Add your Web3Auth client ID:
    CopyVITE_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here



Local Testing

    Run the development server using npm run dev
    Access the application through your browser at the provided URL


Deployment

    If using Vercel or a similar platform:
    
    Ensure your deployment environment is properly configured
    Add the Web3Auth client ID to your environment variables
    Whitelist your deployment URL in your Web3Auth dashboard


Verification

    After deployment, thoroughly test all features
    Confirm that transactions are being processed correctly



Known Issues and Considerations

    The current implementation is functional but may require optimization
    Some aspects of the codebase may benefit from refactoring for improved maintainability
    Ensure all sensitive information (e.g., API keys) is properly secured and not exposed in the repository

Future Improvements

    Implement a more robust version control strategy using Git
    Enhance documentation for smoother onboarding of new developers
    Optimize the build process for improved performance
