# A Journey Through Git and Deployment
With a mix of humility and transparency, I must admit that my journey with Git and proper deployment practices has been far from conventional. This repository stands as a testament to that learning process, with all its missteps and eventual growth.



## The Early Days: Brute Force and Manual Uploads
In the beginning, my interactions with Git were, to put it mildly, rudimentary and often forceful. The `-force` flag became a frequent companion of my till hackaton journey, and the concept of a clean commit history was foreign to me. 

My initial process arriving to this hackaton for "deployment" was equally unrefined:
1. Run `npm run build` locally, creating a "deploy" folder
2. Manually upload the contents of this folder to the GitHub repository

This approach, while functional in the most basic sense, bypassed many of the benefits and safeguards that proper Git usage and deployment processes offer (plus it is actually working good).



## The Wake-Up Call: Live Demo Challenges
The need for a "live demo" brought the shortcomings of this approach into sharp focus. The priotisation of this task was set latefully, so it became painfully clear that the build process was fundamentally flawed, with Vercel - our intended deployment platform - being completely circumvented.



## Learning and Growth
Faced with these challenges, I embarked on a crash course in Git basics and Vite deployment practices in the last 24 hours of the Hackaton. This education, while overdue, has been invaluable.



## Current State
As a result of this learning process:
1. A sister repository now hosts the correctly committed, deployed, and managed version of this code.
2. This repository remains as is - a historical record and a humble reminder of where this journey began.



## Looking Forward
While it's tempting to erase the evidence of past mistakes, I've chosen to keep this repository intact. It serves as a marker of growth and a reminder that everyone starts somewhere in their journey, and even if on the frontend side i know a thing or two, there will be always another topic to learn along the way. To fellow developers, especially those just starting: I would still advocate to embrace the learning process. IMHO Early missteps even if sometimes comic, are not failures, but stepping stones to better practices and deeper understanding.
